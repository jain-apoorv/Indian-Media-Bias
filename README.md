Through this project, focus is on bias through clickbait and framing bias in Indic Languages for Indian society. This is specifically relevant as a major part of the population depend on regional languages for news consumption. Developing automated approaches for low-resource domains can be challenging due to the non-availability of task and domain-specific data. Therefore, Initial focus is on creation of benchmark datasets followed by feature engineering and explainability based approaches for bias detection in Hindi.
